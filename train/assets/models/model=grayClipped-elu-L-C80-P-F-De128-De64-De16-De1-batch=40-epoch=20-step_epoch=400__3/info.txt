Third attempt:
This attempt creates additional data by processing opt flow over three frames instead of two.
The middle frame is skipped, however, its speed is added to the current frames speed to create a realistic label.
Also, the opt_flow function was limiting the features of the opt flow by normalizing each frame to (0,255).
This didn't allow the CNN to see the magnitude of any motion, only what motion was strongest during the frame.
This was replaced with magnitude being divided by 100.
